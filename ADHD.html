                    Researchers found that of 400 students they followed, those with ADHD had a lower grade-point average (GPA) - about half a grade lower - than students without the disorder.

            ADHD (Attention - Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) is a disorder that affects both children and adults. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Having ADHD makes college much harder, as students may have difficulty sustaining attention, staying organized, completing tasks, and following through on instructions. They may also exhibit fidgeting, restlessness, and excessive talking. This also discourages us, it makes us believe that we are not capable of completing tasks, which can be very harmful as a student. ADHD can have a significant impact on a student’s academic and social functioning if left untreated.

            Ways to Cope
        </h2>
        <p class="ADHDText">
            Doctors suggest that the most effective treatment of ADHD would include a combination of medication prescribed by a doctor, educating oneself, raising awareness about ADHD, skills training, and psychological counseling. There are resources on campus such as counseling, however thay may not be the best way of coping with ADHD for everyone. Another way to help cope with ADHD is to create a schedule, but don’t overschedule/ cram many tasks into a short time period. Creating and practicing schedules can help us learn how much time it takes to complete such tasks. It is also important to note that we do not have to finish these tasks all in one go/sitting, but make the effort to take steps to fulfill them. Communicating and connecting with others creates a support system and environment that could help motivation and concentration.

            Connect with Community
        </h2>
        <p class="ADHDText">
            We have created this community in order to share experiences and meet others that share similar experiences while remaining anonymous. One of the most important things about going through this experience is to recognize that you are not alone, and you shouldn’t feel alone. And while we are well aware about the resources available to students on campus, we are not discouraging the use of these resources. We believe in creating a stronger community by bringing students together to communicate and share experiences with other fellow students. We also understand that sharing with another student instead of a professional and/or adult can be more comforting than intimidating, and that attending a university like Rutgers could also be very intimidating and lonely.

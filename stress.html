            Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that causes you to feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. Stress our body's reaction to a challenge or demand. Stress can cause other feelings such as irritability, impatience, overburdened, overwhelmed, anxiety, being unable to enjoy yourself, and depression. Stress can also feel like our thoughts/mind are racing and can't switch off. Stress is greatly caused by money, work, and the economy for Americans. This indicates that job insecurity causes increased stress and decreases the well-being of individuals. This can cause even more stress for students, which is not inclusive of the other stressors students face on a daily basis.  And although stress is common amongst students, it should not be overlooked. It is very important to manage stress effectively, and there are different ways of dealing with stress.

            Ways to Cope
        </h2>
        <p class="stressText">
            Not everyone handles stress the same way, so it is crucial to inform oneself or others about ways to deal with stress. This may be done through self care, social support, seeking professional help, physical activities, connecting with a community you feel safe and comfortable in, and reaching out to others. Types of self care may include but are not limited to practicing mindfulness, taking a break, playing video games, listening to music, reading a book, listening to a podcast, reflecting on things you are grateful for, journaling, drawing/sketching/painting, knitting/sewing, cleaning and/or spending time alone.

            Connect with Community
        </h2>
        <p class="stressText">
            We have created this community in order to share experiences and meet others that share similar experiences while remaining anonymous. One of the most important things about going through this experience is to recognize that you are not alone, and you shouldn’t feel alone. And while we are well aware about the resources available to students on campus, we are not discouraging the use of these resources. We believe in creating a stronger community by bringing students together to communicate and share experiences with other fellow students. We also understand that sharing with another student instead of a professional and/or adult can be more comforting than intimidating, and that attending a university like Rutgers could also be very intimidating and lonely.

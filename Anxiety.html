                    The U.S. Census Bureau previously reported that more than 18 million students were enrolled in college. Within these students, nearly three out of four of these students at some time experienced a sense of “overwhelming anxiety”. Just under 30% report having felt overwhelming anxiety in the previous two weeks.

            Anxiety is an intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Fast heart rates, rapid breathing, sweating, and feeling tired may occur. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. It is a natural human response when we feel that we are under threat. It can be experienced through our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations. There are many types of anxiety, which are generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, agoraphobia, separation anxiety, selective mutism, medication-induced anxiety disorder. All which are specific and, which are not strictly inclusive, include and/or could share different symptoms. Anxiety could be caused by difficult experiences that are not limited to hardships in childhood, adolescence and/or adulthood. Other experiences that may trigger anxiety problems are physical and/or emotional abuse. As students, there are many new challenges we face, often for the first time. We are living away from our families, communities and are often living with new people. We are presented with new surroundings, social situations, and a heavy academic workload. These new challenges can feel overwhelming, leading to depression and/or anxiety. Anxiety is very common amongst students, and some may even share the same types of worries that cause that anxiety. Sharing these experiences has the potential to relieve these worries.

            Ways To Cope
        </h2>
        <p class="AnxietyText">
            Maintaining physical activity, a healthy diet (keeping your intake of caffeine low), regular sleep, relaxation exercises, speaking to a therapist, journaling/ keeping a diary, joining a support group and/or community may help reduce anxiety . To manage symptoms effectively, it's best to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine.

            Connect with Community
        </h2>
        <p class="AnxietyText">
            We have created this community in order to share experiences and meet others that share similar experiences while remaining anonymous. One of the most important things about going through this experience is to recognize that you are not alone, and you shouldn’t feel alone. And while we are well aware about the resources available to students on campus, we are not discouraging the use of these resources. We believe in creating a stronger community by bringing students together to communicate and share experiences with other fellow students. We also understand that sharing with another student instead of a professional and/or adult can be more comforting than intimidating, and that attending a university like Rutgers could also be very intimidating and lonely.

            Although there are different types of depression, depression itself may cause symptoms that affect how we feel, think, and handle daily activities. For us students this means facing difficulty with schoolwork, loss of interest in activities like clubs, sports or other social commitments, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, emotional outbursts like tearfulness or anger, senses of being overwhelmed, panic, lack of energy, and/or thoughts of suicide or self-harm. Depression could be caused by several different factors, which may include academics, social capabilities, race, sexuality, economic class, gender, background/ family history, traumatic experiences, loneliness, alcohol and drugs, pressure, and/or illness. (Feelings and causes stated aren’t mutually exclusive and aren’t all listed) Depression is a mental health issue that is very difficult to deal with, especially since it may lead to and/or cause other mental health issues. It’s crucial to reach out to others if one’s going through depression, but also to reach out to your friends and other individuals. Someone with depression may feel like a burden/bothersome to another, so it’s important to check in on your friends and family, or even new people. The more we make an effort to include others, the more they get a sense of belonging and acceptance.

            Ways To Cope
        </h2>
        <p class="DepressionText">
            Professionals suggest speaking to a therapist and/or taking prescribed medication. Other steps that may be taken in order to cope with depression is trying to make an effort to take part in physical activities. Although there is an understanding that individuals going through depression may experience lack of energy and/or lack of motivation, it is important to remain active and social. Communicating with a friend or any other person could be very helpful in terms of support, whether it may be texting, calling and partial use of social media.

            Connect with Community
        </h2>
        <p class="DepressionText">
            We have created this community in order to share experiences and meet others that share similar experiences while remaining anonymous. One of the most important things about going through this experience is to recognize that you are not alone, and you shouldn’t feel alone. And while we are well aware about the resources available to students on campus, we are not discouraging the use of these resources. We believe in creating a stronger community by bringing students together to communicate and share experiences with other fellow students. We also understand that sharing with another student instead of a professional and/or adult can be more comforting than intimidating, and that attending a university like Rutgers could also be very intimidating and lonely.

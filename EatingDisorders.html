            It’s crucial to understand that although others believe that eating disorders are a choice, that is not the case. Eating disorders are extremely serious and often fatal illnesses that are associated with severe disturbances in our thoughts and emotions, in our eating behaviors. Self-absorbing ourselves/ having an obsession with food, body weight, and shape may signal an eating disorder. (Although we may have thoughts about this, this does not necessarily indicate that we do indeed have an eating disorder.) Eating disorders are very common amongst us college students, and oftentimes they go unnoticed. There are many types of eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (AFRID), rumination disorder, pica and other specified feeding and eating disorders. These types of eating disorders have their respective signs and symptoms, but in some cases it is likely to share them. Researchers found that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors, but there are still more ongoing studies to better understand why they are caused. Brain scans on individuals struggling with eating disorders show that there are different patterns in brain activity compared to an individual that isn’t experiencing an eating disorder. There are countless symptoms that may develop when one is suffering from an eating disorder. These symptoms include but are not limited to thinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis), mild anemia, muscle wasting and weakness, brittle hair and nails, hair loss, dry and yellowish skin, growth of fine hair all over the body (lanugo), severe constipation, low blood pressure, slowed breathing and pulse, damage to the structure and function of the heart, brain damage, multiorgan failure, drop in internal body temperature, lethargy, sluggishness, or feeling tired all the time, and infertility. Since often we may struggle with other mental health issues/disorders, we must learn and understand what eating disorders are and may do to our bodies in order to take steps to recover.

            Ways To Cope
        </h2>
        <p class="EDText">
            Recognizing and seeking treatment early when we are facing eating disorders is extremely vital. Medical care, nutritional counseling, speaking to a doctor for prescribed medications, taking steps to improve our self-esteem, learning healthy ways to respond to our stress and/or emotional pain, speaking to a therapist, group therapy and/or family psychotherapy are different ways we can start to take/consider to start recovering. Expressing ourselves with other people who suffer from eating disorders is also very encouraging to help us take steps to overcome eating disorders. Often we are very self-conscious about eating disorders and/or our appearances, but if we meet and create a safe space for ourselves and others then we are more likely to encourage and support one another.

            Connect with Community
        </h2>
        <p class="EDText">
            We have created this community in order to share experiences and meet others that share similar experiences while remaining anonymous. One of the most important things about going through this experience is to recognize that you are not alone, and you shouldn’t feel alone. And while we are well aware about the resources available to students on campus, we are not discouraging the use of these resources. We believe in creating a stronger community by bringing students together to communicate and share experiences with other fellow students. We also understand that sharing with another student instead of a professional and/or adult can be more comforting than intimidating, and that attending a university like Rutgers could also be very intimidating and lonely.
